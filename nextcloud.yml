      ### Adding proxy network for communication with Traefik
      - traefik_proxy

      ### Add your domain name - Specifying trusted domain for security
      NEXTCLOUD_TRUSTED_DOMAIN: $NEXTCLOUD_DOMAIN_NAME
      ### Add local network as a trusted proxy - It's better to set the actual Traefik IP.
      ###   We will give it the range listed in the accompanying Traefik guide
